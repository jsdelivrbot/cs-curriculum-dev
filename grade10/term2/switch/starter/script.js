 * Write a function that prompts the user to enter a digit between 0 and 4.
 * The function should create an alert containing that number in word form.
 * For example, if the user enters 0, the function alerts "zero".
 * If the user doesn't enter a digit between 0 and 4, tell them they have
 * disobeyed your command!
